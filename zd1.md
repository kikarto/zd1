# ZD1

We want you to have fun doing this test so we've chosen a subject matter that is a little unusual, but should be more fun that other tests you may have done.

Using SWAPI: [https://swapi.dev/](https://swapi.dev/)

Build an application to select random people or starships and render their details to see who would win based on a common attribute.

i.e. people have mass and starships have crew. A person with greater mass wins, a starship with more crew wins.

The app should render the attributes from the resource in a simple web page that allows you to 'play' the game.

Once two cards are displayed the app should declare one of the cards a winner based on the higher common attribute.

Having displayed the winning card , the user should be able to play again using an action button that repeats the same request.

## Bonus points!

These are not required, just adds to your portfolio in an interview:

1. Score counter. If there are two players, left and right, show how many times each side has won.
1. Option to select which resource to play against
1. Use Angular Material and display the details in a card [https://material.angular.io/components/card](https://material.angular.io/components/card)

*What we're looking for*

We're interested in your code style and also best practice.

Please include tests. This is important as this is how we work day-to-day.
